CHATGPT - 2023-10-13 Prompt #1

"im using a generic CreateView and form for my django registration page. 
I have a certain url field that the user may enter, but if they choose not to, will default to a link I've already set. 
The problem is the form starts with the default field already  filled in, which is a bit ugly. 
Is there any way to set this field to the default link ONLY if the user doesn't enter anything for that field, 
and only after they've submitted the sign up form?"

class RegistrationView(CreateView):
    model = YourUserModel  # Replace with your actual user model
    form_class = YourRegistrationForm
    template_name = 'registration.html'  # Replace with your template

    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Check if the user provided a value for the URL field
        if not form.cleaned_data.get('url_field'):
            # If the field is empty, set it to the default value
            form.cleaned_data['url_field'] = 'https://example.com'

        # Save the user or perform any other necessary actions
        return super().form_valid(form)

CHATGPT - 2023-10-13 Prompt #2

my form_valid() function isn't working; when I look at a user's profile in django admin, the profile_image field is empty, 
even if they didn't enter one (if they don't enter one, it's supposed to set it as that link I'm setting there)

class SignUpView(CreateView):
    form_class = AuthorCreationForm
    success_url = reverse_lazy('login')
    template_name = "registration/signup.html"

    def form_valid(self, form):
        if not form.cleaned_data.get('profile_image'):
            form.instance.profile_image = 'https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/71/08/24/360_F_571082432_Qq45LQGlZsuby0ZGbrd79aUTSQikgcgc.jpg'

        return super().form_valid(form)

Notes: used form.instance.profile_image line to get the previous prompt working properly.
